# Restaurant Rating Prediction 

In this Project, we are going to see an End to End Project kind thing on  Restaurant Descriptive Analytics and Predicting Rating for Each restaurant depends on its facilities and Features that each restaurant provides.
The basic idea of analyzing the dataset is to get a fair idea about the factors affecting the establishment of different types of the restaurant at different places, aggregate rating of each restaurant.
From all the Data available, we can bring out some neat insights or conclusions such as

Which franchise has the highest number of Restaurants?

How many Restaurants are accepting online orders?

How many have a book table facility?

Which location has the highest number of Restaurants?

How many types of Restaurant types are there?

What is the most liked Restaurant type?

What is the Average cost for 2 persons?

What is the most liked Dish type?
